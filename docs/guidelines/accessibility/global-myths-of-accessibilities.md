# Myths of web accessibility

People who are unfamiliar with web accessibility tend to misunderstand it. If you believe some things shown below, read through our documentation and you will begin to see web accessibility in more positive way.

## 1. People who have disabilities do not use my website.

The World Health Organization estimates that about 15% of the global population has a disability, and most of this large swath of the population participates in today’s internet-centric culture. There is no way of knowing how much of your site's traffic is allocated to individuals with disabilities. Sophisticated analytics can tell you a lot about your site visitors' browsers, countries, or basic demographics, but they cannot tell you who has an impairment and who doesn't.

## 2. There is no economic benefit in making my website more accessible.

Although there are costs in making your site accessible, the economic benefits can be vast. Individuals with disabilities still comprise a sizable part of the population, and even users who do not have disabilities can benefit from a smoother user experience.

## 3.Web accessibility is only for the disabled.

Though the main purpose of accessibility testing is to serve differently abled users, there are many instances in which implementing accessibility guidelines have benefited the overall user base.

So even though performance improvement was never an integral part of the original requirements, by addressing the accessibility concerns, we were able to improve the performance of the application and benefit the entire user base.

## 4. Website accessibility is expensive, difficult and time-consuming.

There is no special Accessible HTML or Accessible CSS. The same languages and technologies are used, but perhaps with more understanding, attention to detail, and in accordance with some guidelines.

WCAG guidelines can seem daunting at first. However, accessibility compliance isn't nearly as difficult or expensive as people tend to think it will be, especially if you do things the right way from the beginning. Learning accessibility guidelines is also a good investment in that considering the needs of all the site’s users improves the quality of your web design over time.

## 5. It's impossible to make my content accessible.

The ADA requires reasonable efforts and accommodations, but you need not completely change your website. If your site features music, you don't have to stop using it simply because you might have deaf visitors.

## 6. My website needs to become text-only.

WCAG guidelines don't forbid you from using images, videos, and other assets. And including alternative text and removing color-based instructions won’t prevent you from having a visually-appealing and media-rich website. There's no need for a boring and dated-looking site that is text-only.

## 7. Accessible websites are ugly and boring.

The misconception comes from the early days of the Internet, when technology restricted the developer’s choice in terms of accessibility and design. But times have changed. It is now absolutely possible to create a beautiful, media-rich, interactive, and engaging website that is also accessible.

Accessibility guidelines don’t forbid anyone to use images, videos, or Java scripts on their websites. The only suggestion is that if you do, make sure that the content of the website is still accessible to all sets of users.

## 8. I only need to consider the needs of the blind when designing an accessible website.

Although blind users' needs are important in determining how accessible your website is, there are also users with motor impairments. Individuals who are colorblind, deaf or hard of hearing, and those with cognitive and neurological disabilities all have different design considerations as well. The end goal is to create one great user experience for everyone, regardless of any disabilities they have — or don’t have. Accessible design benefits everyone.

## 9. Automated evaluation tools are sufficient to determine my website’s accessibility.

Automated evaluation tools are very helpful, as they can reduce the time and effort necessary for accessibility testing by identifying some potential issues.

However, they can’t replace manual testing. Many of the accessibility checkpoints are not objective enough to be tested automatically, so they require human intervention and judgment. For example, an automation tool can check if an image has an alternate text description, but it won’t be able to judge if the description provided by the text is accurate and meaningful.

## 10. I only have to worry about accessibility guidelines if I’m a web developer or designer.

It’s true that web developers and designers must do most of the heavy lifting in creating accessible websites. But it is also management's responsibility to keep accessibility in mind, and the same goes for editors, artists, and anyone else involved in creating and managing the website.

## 11. My personal website needs to meet ADA accessibility standards.

Currently, accessibility regulations apply to websites that provide "goods, services, and programs to the public," such as government websites, shopping, and e-commerce. This distinction can fall into a gray area based on traffic and intent of a website, meaning personal private sites aren’t necessarily subject to accessibility standards. It, however, is a good idea to make your personal website accessible for a better user experience for all.
