## What is web accessibility?

Web accessibility means **making your website available to as many people as possible**.

It’s a combination of common sense, empathy and understanding.

Web accessibility refers to the **inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities**.

Web accessibility consists of two parts:

* philosophy — equivalent user experience
* process — techniques + code \(what we build on line\)

They both are equally important to achieve the goal of creating an accessible website.
