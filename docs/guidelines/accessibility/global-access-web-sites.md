## What it takes to access web sites

Some components are involved to make websites available to any of us. First, we have information to put on a website. We refer it as **web content**. Second, we need tools to create a website, which is categorized as **authoring tools**. Third, we need means to get to the website. That is **user agents**. Let's take a look at each component closely.

### Web content

It is any part of a web site such as:

* text
* images
* forms
* multimedia \(audio, video, animation\) \[content requires another layer of means to access its content\]
* any markup code
* scripts 
* applications

### Authoring tools

They are the tools to build a website. They can be software or services that people use to produce web content. Here are some of them:

* code editors
* document conversion tools
* content management systems
* blogs
* database scripts

### User agents

Software that people use to access web content:

* desktop graphical browsers
* voice browsers
* mobile phone browsers
* multimedia players
* plug-ins 
* assistive technologies

To be able to access a website, these components need to play well together. If web content is not available, you wouldn't see anything on the website. If authoring tools are not available, you couldn't have your information or messages on your website. If user agents are not available, you cannot get to the website or the content on the website. Every component is equally important to make a website available.

Web accessibility principles and techniques support these components to optimize their capabilities to make websites available to broad range of users.
