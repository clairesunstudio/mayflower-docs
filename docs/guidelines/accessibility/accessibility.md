## Web accessibility and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

All government digital products are required to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/).

Mayflower is a design system for the the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
. It is designed and developed to meet such web accessibility guidelines.  If you follow this system's samples, your website would be accessible by broad range of users.

As technology evolves, some methods to meet the guidelines could get outdated. We will update outdated ones though our periodical accessibility testing. Such updates are addressed at [TBD:  CHANGELOG, RELEASE NOTES OR ACCESSIBILITY TEST REPORTS????].

We value web accessibility, and consider it is important to promote it to anybody who own and work on websites. Here, you'll find resources for web accessibility from basic concepts to technical approaches.
