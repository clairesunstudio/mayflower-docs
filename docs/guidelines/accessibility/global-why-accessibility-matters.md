# Why web accessibility matters

Web accessibility means removing barriers that prevent people from interacting with or accessing websites. It’s a combination of common sense, empathy, and understanding.

Web accessibility consists of two parts:

* Philosophy — Ensuring that you provide an equivalent user experience for all users

* Process — techniques + code that let us implement this philosophy

They both are equally important to achieve the goal of creating an accessible website.

## Giving more people more access

Today,  access to online information is essential to our daily lives. Making web content accessible allows more people to take advantage of this important web content, and contributes to increased independence and freedom. 

According to [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/), most studies find that about one fifth \(20%\) of the population has some kind of disability.

Even though not all of these people have disabilities that make them difficult to access the internet, it is still a significant portion of the population. 

The [United Nations Population Fund \(UNFPA\)](https://www.unfpa.org/publications/ageing-twenty-first-century) projects that in the future, we’ll have a larger number of seniors, and the number of people with disabilities will grow. Remember, we are all temporarily able-bodied.
