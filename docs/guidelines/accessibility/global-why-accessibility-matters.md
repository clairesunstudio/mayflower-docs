# Why web accessibility matters

Web accessibility means removing barriers that prevent people from interacting with or accessing websites. It’s a combination of common sense, empathy, and understanding.

Web accessibility consists of two parts:

* **Philosophy** — Ensuring that you provide an equivalent user experience for all users.
* **Process** — Techniques & code that let us implement this philosophy.

They both are equally important to achieve the goal of creating an accessible website.

## Giving more people more access

Today, access to online information is essential to our daily lives. Making web content accessible allows more people to take advantage of this important web content, and contributes to increased independence and freedom.

According to [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/), most studies find that about one fifth \(20%\) of the population has some kind of disability. While not all disabilities make it difficult to interact with technology and the web, this population represent a significant audience for any web products. Further, as the population ages, the [United Nations Population Fund \(UNFPA\)](https://www.unfpa.org/publications/ageing-twenty-first-century) projects that the number of people with disabilities will grow.
