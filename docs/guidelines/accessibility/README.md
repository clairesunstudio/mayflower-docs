# Accessibility

## Web accessibility and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

All government digital products in the U.S. need to be accessible. Accessibility means making sure your website is available to as many people as possible. It also means your site needs to conform to [Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act](http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm), [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies) and the [Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\)](https://www.ada.gov/).

To make sure that your Commonwealth of Massachusetts website meets these requirements, weâ€™ve developed Mayflower, a design system that meets [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0 and 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). Using Mayflower correctly will ensure that a broad range of users can access your website.

### Staying up to date

As technology evolves, some methods to intend to meet the guidelines could get outdated. We will update outdated ones though our periodical accessibility testing. Such updates are addressed at \[TBD: CHANGELOG, RELEASE NOTES OR ACCESSIBILITY TEST REPORTS????\].

We value web accessibility, and consider it is important to promote it to anybody who own and work on websites. Here, you'll find resources for web accessibility from basic concepts to technical approaches.
