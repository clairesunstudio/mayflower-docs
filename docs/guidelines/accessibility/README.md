# Accessibility

## Web accessibility and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

All government digital products in the US are required to conform to [Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act](http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm), [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies) and the [Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\)](https://www.ada.gov/).

Mayflower is a design system for the the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It is designed and developed to meet such web accessibility guidelines with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0 and 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). If you follow this system's samples, your website would be accessible by broad range of users.

As technology evolves, some methods to intend to meet the guidelines could get outdated. We will update outdated ones though our periodical accessibility testing. Such updates are addressed at \[TBD: CHANGELOG, RELEASE NOTES OR ACCESSIBILITY TEST REPORTS????\].

We value web accessibility, and consider it is important to promote it to anybody who own and work on websites. Here, you'll find resources for web accessibility from basic concepts to technical approaches.
