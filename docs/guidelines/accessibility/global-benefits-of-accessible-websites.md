# Benefits of having an accessible website

Let's take a look at some of the reasons it’s important to have an accessible website.

## 1. Improve the lives of people with disabilities

Accessible websites are part of a culture of accessibility and inclusion. Web accessibility is essential for equal opportunity.

## 2. Build positive public relations

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - Accessible websites include, and inaccessible websites exclude. Providing an accessible website is one way your organization can demonstrate that it’s helping to support the  needs of a diverse society.

Having an accessible website can also contribute positively to your organization’s public image. 

Taking responsibility for your organization’s social impact can enhance your brand, increase sales and customer loyalty, provide more access to capital and funding, and make your organization more attractive to potential employees.

## 3. Broaden your market penetration

According to a [2010 report from the U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2012/demo/p70-131.pdf), around 18.7% of the U.S. population lives with a disability and, out of that number, 12.6% have a severe disability. If you want to have the largest audience/customer base possible, make sure this population can access your website.

A [study in the United Kingdom \(UK\)](https://disability-smart.com/2017/01/10/is-there-really-a-business-case-for-website-accessibility/) found that 71% of web users with a disability will simply leave a website that is not accessible.

## 4. Avoid discrimination and legal complications

In the U.S., public sector organizations (government-funded programs/schools, airlines, and nonprofits) are required to follow certain website accessibility rules. Having an accessible website means complying with your country’s equality and anti-discrimination law.  U.S. government websites need to conform to [Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm), [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies) and the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/).

Both governments and private organizations are becoming subject to legal challenges because of their inaccessible online content and service offerings.

Private sector companies can be sued if they fail to adhere to accessibility guidelines.

## 5. Better Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\)

Search engines prefer accessible websites.  Most search engines are only able to process text and the way it is structured. By having a well-marked up site, they can index your site for more relevant information in search results.

## 6. Improve usability for all types of users

Accessibility is not just about users who have disabilities. It also means designing for users who:

* Have a slow Internet connection
  * For example, rural areas where high speed connections are not available or mobile phone reception is limited
  * bandwidth congestion
* Use older technologies
  * old web browser
  * operating system
* Have a small screen or [an unusual device](https://deviceatlas.com/blog/which-devices-have-browsers)
* Can't listen to audio content because of where they are \(e.g. work, hospital, library\)
* Infrequent or beginning web users who might not have as much technological literacy as experienced web users

## 7. Produce a high quality and highly flexible website

Accessible design can also improve the technical side of your website by:

* Reducing how long and how much it costs to develop and maintain your site 
* Enabling content works across platforms, such as mobile devices, screen readers, and different operating systems and browsers
* Making sure you’re “Future proofed,” or prepared to implement future technologies
