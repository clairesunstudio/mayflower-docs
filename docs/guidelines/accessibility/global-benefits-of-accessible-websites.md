## Benefits of having an accessible website

Let's take a look at some benefits of having accessible website, and these are also reasons **why you make your website accessible**.

### 1. Improve the lives of people with disabilities

You do something positive for the world. You promote a culture of accessibility and inclusion. Web accessibility is essential for equal opportunity.

Corporate Social Responsibility \(CSR\) - When an organization's website is not accessible, it further excludes people with disabilities from society. When an organization's website is accessible, it empowers people with disabilities to participate in society. Providing an accessible website is one way an organization can demonstrate that it strives to meet the access needs of a diverse society.

### 2. Build positive public relations

An organization's efforts in Web accessibility are a public relations opportunity to increase its positive image, which can increase website use.

Corporate Social Responsibility \(CSR\) has been shown to improve financial performance, enhance brand image and reputation, increase sales and customer loyalty, increase ability to attract and retain employees, and provide access to capital and funding. Additional perspectives on CSR, such as statistics that show how CSR impacts customers, are available on the Web.

### 3. Broaden your market penetration

You expand your customer/audience base. According to a [2010 report from the U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2012/demo/p70-131.pdf), around 18.7% of the U.S. population lives with a disability and, out of that number, 12.6% have a severe disability.

A [study in the United Kingdom \(UK\)](https://disability-smart.com/2017/01/10/is-there-really-a-business-case-for-website-accessibility/) found that 71% of web users with a disability will simply leave a website that is not accessible.

### 4. Avoid discrimination and legal complications

Your website will comply with your country’s equality and anti-discrimination law.

Internationally, governments, but also private companies and organisations, are becoming subject to legal challenges because of their inaccessible online content and service offerings.

In the US, public sector entities \(government-funded programs/schools, airlines, and nonprofits\) are required to follow certain website accessibility rules, while private sector companies just [hope they will not get sued](https://insight.cryptzone.com/accessibility/6-web-accessibility-takeaways-winn-dixie-accessibility-decision/).

In 2017 the Information and Communication Technology \(ICT\) passed a ruling to update the old 508 rules to be more inline with WCAG 2.0 guidelines, meaning that website accessibility updates are required for most public websites — and it is just a matter of time before private websites will be as well.

### 5. Better Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\)

Accessibility techniques increase the findability of web pages by exposing content to search engines, both internally \(within a website\) and externally \(across the World Wide Web\). Most of the search engines are only able to process text and the way it is structured. By having a well-marked up site, they can index your site for more relevant information in search results.

### 6. Improve usability for all types of users

Not just people with disabilities, but web accessibility also helps people who:

* Have a slow Internet connection
  * location- for example, rural areas where high speed connections are not available or mobile phone reception is limited
  * bandwidth congestion
* Use older technologies
  * old web browser
  * operating system
* Have a small screen or unusual device
* Can't listen to audio content in where they are at the moment \(ex. work, hospital, etc.\)
* Are not familiar with the technologies involved to use websites
  * infrequent Web users
  * new to Web

### 7. Produce a high quality and highly flexible website

* Reduces site development and maintenance time and cost
* Enables content on different configurations, such as mobile devices, screen readers, different operating systems and browsers;
* ‘Future proofed’, that means being prepared for implementing future technologies;
* Cross-browser compatibility.
