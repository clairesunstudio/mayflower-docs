### Accessibility & Best Practices

The label and the text field have to be paired to identify the text field.

`<label>` requires `for` attribute to establish the association with the text field and describe the field. So, users can understand what this text field is for.

The `for` attribute share the same value with its paired `<input>`'s `id` to establish their association.

`id` is required to `<input type="date">`. Ensure its value is unique in the page.

Assistive technologies use this association to identify the field to the user.
