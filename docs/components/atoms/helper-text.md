# Helper Text

## Overview

Helper text provides supplemental information. It gives context about a fieldâ€™s input, such as how the input will be used. It should be always visible.

## Usage

Helper text should be used only where needed. It can be a great way of eliminating confusion and possible errors that the user might face when dealing with input field. As a rule of thumb, do not exceed 100 words of explanation.

It should be positioned where its association with the form element to provide information for is clear.

Helper text is different from an error message.

### Accessibility & Best Practices

The placement pattern for helper text should be consistent through the site.

Helper text is paired with its associated form element. Its container `<div>` has a unique `id` in the page, and its value is shared with the `aria-describedby` attribute of the form element.
