### Ordered List

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="HTML" %}
```markup
<ol>
  <li>This is a list item in an ordered list
  <li>An ordered list is a list in which the sequence of items is important. Top level item counters are digits
  <li>
    Lists can be nested inside of each other
    <ol>
      <li>This is a nested list item. After digits list items counters are lower-alpha.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is another nested list item in an ordered list
        <ol>
          <li>
            This is a nested list item. After lower-alpha counters, lower-roman counters are used.
            <ol>
              <li>This is a nested list item. After lower-roman counters, the counters loop back to digits.</li>
              <li>This is another nested list item in an ordered list</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>This is another nested list item in an ordered list
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>This is the last list item
</ol>
